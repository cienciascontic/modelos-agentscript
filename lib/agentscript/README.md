### AgentScript

AgentScript is a minimalist Agent Based Modeling (ABM) framework based on [NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) (NL) agent semantics.  Its goal is to promote the Agent Oriented Programming model in a highly deployable [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)/JavaScript (CS/JS) implementation.

#### Build

Currently we use a very simple build process using the coffeescript -wj
command which "joins" the individual coffeescript files, compiling
them on change, creating agentscript.js.

    files="\
      util.coffee \
      shapes.coffee \
      agentset.coffee \
      agentsets.coffee \
      model.coffee \
    "
    coffee -wj agentscript.js -c $files &

See the template.html and models/*.html files for example models.  The individual
.coffee files are documented via Jeremy Ashkenas's
[docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/) in the docs/ dir using the method suggested [here](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/[HowTo]-Compiling-and-Setting-Up-Build-Tools).

#### Documentation

Currently the documentation is hosted directly on github via the [rawgithub](https://rawgithub.com/) project using the docco generated html found in the doc/ directory.  One exception is the template.html file in the top level directory.

[**util.coffee**](https://rawgithub.com/backspaces/agentscript/master/docs/1-util.html): is the base module for all of the miscellaneous functions used by the rest of the project.

[**shapes.coffee**](https://rawgithub.com/backspaces/agentscript/master/docs/2-shapes.html): is a simple agent shapes module containing the default shapes and a few functions for getting the named shapes and adding your own shapes.

[**agentset.coffee**](https://rawgithub.com/backspaces/agentscript/master/docs/3-agentset.html) is the core array subclass used by patches, agents, and links.

[**agentsets.coffee**](https://rawgithub.com/backspaces/agentscript/master/docs/4-agentsets.html) contains the three subclasses of AgentSet: Patches, Agents, and Links along with the three classes they manage: Patch, Agent, and Link.

[**model.coffee**](https://rawgithub.com/backspaces/agentscript/master/docs/5-model.html) is the top level integration for all the agentsets and is subclassed by all user models. 

[**template.html**](https://rawgithub.com/backspaces/agentscript/master/docs/6-template.html) is a trivial subclass of Model showing the basic structure how you build your own models.  In addition, the models/ directory contains 10 simple models used in teaching NetLogo. You can [run the model here.](https://rawgithub.com/backspaces/agentscript/master/template.html) 

#### Sample Models

The models/ directory contains tiny models used to test the system and offer examples to get started with.  I also use the rawgithub project to view directly on github.  These usually print to the console.log, so opening the developer's javascript console will show model information.

[**ants.html**](https://rawgithub.com/backspaces/agentscript/master/models/ants.html) Ant foraging with nest and food pheromone diffusion. 

[**buttons.html**](https://rawgithub.com/backspaces/agentscript/master/models/buttons.html) Stuart Kauffman's example of randomly connecting pairs of buttons in a pile resulting in a tipping point.

[**diffusion.html**](https://rawgithub.com/backspaces/agentscript/master/models/diffusion.html) Agents randomly flying on a patch grid dropping a color which is diffused over the grid.

[**fire.html**](https://rawgithub.com/backspaces/agentscript/master/models/fire.html) A CA based spread of fire showing burn behavior.

[**flock.html**](https://rawgithub.com/backspaces/agentscript/master/models/flock.html) The classic "boids" model where agents use three simple rules resulting in realistic flocking.

[**gridpath.html**](https://rawgithub.com/backspaces/agentscript/master/models/gridpath.html) One of Knuth's great puzzles on the probability of all Manhattan  traversals diagonally traversing a grid.

[**linktravel.html**](https://rawgithub.com/backspaces/agentscript/master/models/linktravel.html) Agents traversing a graph of nodes and links.

[**nbody.html**](https://rawgithub.com/backspaces/agentscript/master/models/nbody.html) Nonlinear gravitation of n bodies.

[**prefattach.html**](https://rawgithub.com/backspaces/agentscript/master/models/prefattach.html) Example of a dynamic graph with new links preferentially attaching to nodes with most links.  This results in a power-law distribution.

[**tspga.html**](https://rawgithub.com/backspaces/agentscript/master/models/tspga.html) A Traveling Sales Person solution via a Genetic Algorithm showing the rapid conversion of stochastic methods.

#### Sample Models Format

Our example models use CoffeeScript directly within the browser via `text/coffeescript` [script tags](http://coffeescript.org/#scripts):

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>AgentScript Model</title>
        <script src="agentscript.js"></script>
        <script src="coffee-script.js"></script>
        <script type="text/coffeescript">
        class MyModel extends ABM.Model
              ...
        APP=new MyModel "layers", 13, -16, 16, -16, 16
              ...
        </script>
      </head>
      <body onload="ABM.model.start()">
        <div id="layers" style="position:relative;padding:20;"></div>
      </body>
    </html>

You may see this by running a sample model, then use the browser's View Page Source.  (Google "view page source `<`my browser`>`")

Similarly, the models will print to the "javascript console" while they run. (Google "view javascript console `<`my browser`>`")
